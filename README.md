Avalanches kill over 150 people worldwide every year.[^1] After getting caught in an avalanche, your chances of survival in the first 15 minutes are around 90%. After 30 minutes, your chances drop to 30%. Rescue teams must get to avalanche victims in the fastest time possible.
[^1]: [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/avalanche/)

**The end goal of this project is to**

- Create an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) that can search for and detect signals emitted from avalanche transceivers
-  Mark the victim's locations autonomously
-  Reduce search time for avalanche victims.

## Getting Started

  
### Set up

Before getting started, you will need to install a few libraries. To do so, run **setup.py**

  ```{bash)
  python3 setup.py
  ```
 
 #### QGroundControl
 
 Avidrone search is compatible with the original version of QGroundControl while using command line arguments, and a few other steps. 
 
<!--  TODO Add GUI tutorial here -->
To use our custom build of QGroundControl, you will need to follow this [guide](linkGUI)

You can find more details about using QGroundControl in the [frontend](https://github.com/AviDrone/frontend) repository.

<!-- TODO Add youtube video -->
You can also see this video [walktrhough](https://youtu.be/glC99FwFnAc) to learn how to connect and interact with the UAV. 


## How to use

### Search

To run a full search mission using command-line arguments, run the following command from the root directory

  ```{bash)
  avidrone-search --run
  ```
  
 To run primary search only, use the following command
 
  ```{bash)
  avidrone-search --primary
  ```
  
 To run secondary search only, use the following command
 
 
  ```{bash)
  avidrone-search --secondary
  ```
