Avalanches kill over 150 people worldwide every year.[^1] After getting caught in an avalanche, your chances of survival in the first 15 minutes are around 90%. After 30 minutes, your chances drop to 30%. Rescue teams must get to avalanche victims in the fastest time possible.

## Objective

Our objective for this project is to use Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to search for avalanche transceiver signals. This allows rescuers to

- Search over unsafe avalanche debris
- Flag the victim's locations autonomously
- Reduce search time for avalanche victims.

## Getting Started

To clone this repository, run the following command on your terminal.

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/AviDrone/backend.git --single-branch --branch main
```

### Set up

Before getting started, you will need to install a few libraries by running **install.sh**.

  ```{bash)
chmod -x install.sh && bash install.sh
  ```

This will take care of installing the libraries used in the backend of this project.

It is possible to run a search mission using our command line arguments (CLI) arguments, but using our frontend will defenitely speed things up. To install QGroundControl for Avidrone, see the [frontend repository](https://github.com/AviDrone/frontend).

#### Running a transceiver simulation


### Search

To run a full search mission using command-line arguments, run the following command from the root directory

  ```{bash)
  avidrone-search --run
  ```
  
 To run primary search only, use the following command

  ```{bash)
  avidrone-search --primary
  ```
  
 To run secondary search only, use the following command

  ```{bash)
  avidrone-search --secondary
  ```
  
  We recommend that you also run the following command to see what other things you can do with avidrone-search
  
  ```{bash)
  avidrone-search --help
  ```
  
### Simulation

To run a simulated search mission, you will need
